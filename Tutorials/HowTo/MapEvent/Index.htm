            Map Events</h2>
        <p>
            An event is a <b>“point and click”</b> programmable object that activates and triggers
            at given conditions and performs actions you set it to do. Events can be used to
            create NPC characters, objects such a doors and chests, and enemies.</p>
        <p>
            <u>In order to understand this tutorial, make sure to have read the previous tutorials</u>.</p>
        <p>
            To create an event on the map, open a map.</p>
        <p>
            Check the
            <img src="mapEventBtn.PNG" width="20" height="26" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" />
            button. <b>Double click</b> on the map and a new window should appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event is now created but it needs some life to it. For this tutorial, we create
            an NPC character that randomly walks around in just a few steps.</p>
        <p>
            <u>First</u>, if you are not using a template, make a new animation of a sprite
            walking. It only requires one action (name it "Walk") and 4-directions. Make sure
            to add its collision information.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Double click</b> the gray box at top-left side of the event.</li>
            <li>Choose a suitable animation for walking.</li>
            <li>Select the default direction and click OK.</li>
            <li>Next, we need to tell it to move. Click <b>Program Dynamics</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Move Random</b> and press OK.</li>
            <li><b>Check</b> Repeat and Ignore Impassible and press OK.</li>
            <li>Close the event dialog and you are done! </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You&#39;ll notice the event will look similar to this if you uncheck
    <font size="3" face="Calibri, Calibri">
            <img src="mapEventBtn.PNG" width="20" height="26" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" />.</font></p>
            <p><img src="mapEvent.PNG" /></p>
    <p>The <b>orange</b> circle with the number states the <b>layer</b> the event is on. In 
        this case, this event was on layer 0. You can select an Event <b>only if</b> you are on the 
        layer it is on.</p>
    <p>
            Do not delete this event as you will be able to test it in just a few tutorials later.</p>
        <p>

            RPG tutorials.</p>
