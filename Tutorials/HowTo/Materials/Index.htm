        <p>
            Materials are images, audios, videos and fonts that you can use in your game.</p>
        <p>
            In order to import your own material, first move your mouse over to the <b>Materials</b>
            tab. If not visible, go to <b>View</b> and click on <b>Material Explorer</b>. You
            should see:
            <p>
                <img src="materialtools.PNG" width="152" height="52" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /></p>
            <p>
                The white icon
                <img src="importBtn.PNG" width="29" height="31" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" />
                allows you to <b>import resources</b>. Click on it and find an image you would like
                to import. Double click it to add it in.</p>
            <p>
                You can also add your own folders and organize your files and folders by dragging
                and dropping. You can also cut/paste instead of drag and drop.</p>
