    <h2>
        Animations</h2>
    <font size="3" face="Calibri, Calibri">
        <p>
            Animations are grouped graphics for your characters and other objects. Animations are <b>used
                by</b> Events, Projectiles, Heroes and Enemies.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Open</b> the Animation editor by clicking the <b>Animations</b> button in the
            menu.</p>
        <p>
            If your game uses <b>sprite sheets</b> (recommended), it is just a few
            click to create an animation.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Add a new animation by clicking the green PLUS button in the panel "Animations".<p>
                <img src="animations.PNG" width="91" height="49" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>Add a new action (Actions) and right-click and rename it to "Walk". </li>
            <li>Click the "From Sprite Sheet" button to the right.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The following should appear:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="spriteSheetDialog.PNG" width="241" height="162" alt="" title="" border="0"
                align="" /></p>
        <p>
            <b>Display time</b> is amount of time each frame should be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Directions</b> are row based and since not all sprite sheets are in the same
            order of "Up/Down/ect.", we allow you to re-order the directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, if "Up" is in the second row of your sprite sheet, then move "Up" down
            once. Test it out by importing a walking character from the RP.</p>
        <p>
            If your graphics are not sprite sheets, you'll have to manually add frames to each
            direction of each action. We are working on making this easier…</p>
        <p>
            Once you create a frame, drag and drop your material from the material explorer.
            Repeat this process for other frames to get the desired effect. You can have more
            than one image in a frame.</p>
