    <h2>Creating a Hero</h2>
<p>Heroes are essential to your game. A hero is a <b>representation</b> of the player and so in order to have a player, you'll need at least one hero.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>Open the Heroes editor by clicking <img src="heroesBtn.PNG" width="65" height="26" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" />.</li>
    <li>Add a new hero by clicking green PLUS sign.</li>
    <li>Add the heroes Animation by double clicking the <b>gray box</b>.</li>
    <li>Assign <b>Idle</b> and <b>Walk</b> actions by clicking <b>"Assign Actions"</b> button.</li>
<ul>
    <li>You only need Idle, which can be a still of the heroe's sprite or an actual idle animation, and you need a Walk animation. The idle animation can simply be made from Walk animation by removing the "step" frames.</li>
</ul> 
    <li>Once the actions are assigned, you can use the hero as a <b>player</b></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a lot more you can do to heroes. To learn more, check out tutorials for specific genres such as the RPG tutorials.</p>
